An engine for turn-based multiplayer games, especially ones played on
a hex grid. The idea is to combine server code for multiple projects
to share code for similar needs such as persistence, chatting, and
user management. It's also possible to combine multiple actual servers
into one binary to host several game types on one port and allow
communication among users across different games.

It is currently unoptimized and at most be lightly optimized;
it being an engine for _turn-based_ games means that achieving
speed that support twitch gameplay is not a priority. It will
always be stream-based, and is currently based on serialization
to an ASCII form.

Currently the implemented game is the board game Hex.
